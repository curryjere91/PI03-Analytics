# <h1 align="center">**`Airplane fatalities`**</h1>


## **Introduction**


This project is a small summary of data analysis from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), highlighting the importance of historical data on air accidents. These unexpected events have devastating consequences, and by systematically studying accident data and patterns, contributing factors can be identified to enhance safety measures. The report emphasizes the collaborative efforts of the aviation industry, regulatory authorities, and researchers in striving for improved safety and prevention of future accidents.


## **Objective**

The aim of this project was to develop an interactive dashboard that enables users to explore the data and extract relevant information about aircraft accidents. With these findings a report was generated in Power BI.

The dataset used for this was a list of worldwide aircraft accidents spanning from 1908 to 2021. The data was thoroughly analyzed and visualized to identify patterns and trends pertaining to the variety of accidents, as well as their fatality rate.

## **Scope**

`ETL and EDA`
Performed the necessary transformations to the base csv files, modified and merged together with other csv as needed to gain insights on the data. Continued with some graphics and comprehensive analysis using matplotlib to visualize the relationships between the diffent types of data found in the datasets.

`Report`
A more detailed report that includes insights on the data has been written to separate it from the README. In this report you will find part of the thought process that came from some of the graphs that were also added on the Power BI dashboard.

`Analysis`
The final analysis has been condensed on a Power BI dashboard with more detailed trends and interactive metrics.
