# <h1 align="center">**`Airplane fatalities`**</h1>


## **Introduction**


This project is a small summary of data analysis from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), highlighting the importance of historical data on air accidents. These unexpected events have devastating consequences, and by systematically studying accident data and patterns, contributing factors can be identified to enhance safety measures. The report emphasizes the collaborative efforts of the aviation industry, regulatory authorities, and researchers in striving for improved safety and prevention of future accidents.


## **Objective**

The project aims to develop an interactive dashboard that enables users to explore the data and extract relevant information about aircraft accidents. Additionally, a comprehensive report will be generated to present the findings derived from the analyzed data.

To accomplish this objective, a database of aircraft accidents worldwide spanning from 1908 to 2021 was utilized. The data was thoroughly analyzed and visualized to identify patterns and trends pertaining to civil aviation safety.

## **Scope**

`ETL and EDA`
Performed the necessary transformations to the base csv files, modified and merged together with other csv as needed to gain insights on the data. Continued with some graphics and comprehensive analysis using matplotlib to visualize the relationships between the diffent types of data found in the datasets.

`Analysis`
The final analysis has been condensed on a Power BI dashboard with more detailed trends and interactive metrics.
